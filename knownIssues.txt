Known Issues:
1. If any wrong information is typed the user gets a message and is back to the main menu
  for example: if you entered a 3 number id it will say the id is wrong and couldn't create the user but wont ask you to
  type again(it's more of a feature than an issue)
2. When adding a citizen to be a member of a party it has default values for name and year because if the id of the citizen is already in the array
   we add him to the members array by pointer and we dont need to create another citizen
3. Some functions are not in use we didnt delete them for future use.
4. We only print the party name for the candidate to not overload to much text for the user
5. When adding a candidate we first create it as a citizen and then pass it to the candidate constructor
6. if a user didnt come protected we dont let him vote - the law is the law
7.The exception for id and age is thrown only after we asked for all the information that's because the exceptions are inside the c'tor
8.We didnt add anymore exceptions except where we were asked
